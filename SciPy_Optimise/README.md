# `scipy.optimize`
- Optimization and root finding (scipy.optimize)
- SciPy optimize provides functions for minimizing (or maximizing) objective functions, possibly subject to constraints. It includes solvers for nonlinear problems (with support for both local and global optimization algorithms), linear programing, constrained and nonlinear least-squares, root finding, and curve fitting.
- This repository is an attempt to collect templates, scripts and tutorials.
