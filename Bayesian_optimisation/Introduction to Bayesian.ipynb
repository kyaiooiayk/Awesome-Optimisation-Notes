    "### Likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood represents the information in the observed data, and is used to update prior distributions to posterior distributions. This updating of belief is justified becuase of the **likelihood principle**, which states:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Following observation of \\\\(y\\\\), the likelihood \\\\(L(\\theta|y)\\\\) contains all experimental information from \\\\(y\\\\) about the unknown \\\\(\\theta\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian analysis satisfies the likelihood principle because the posterior distribution's dependence on the data is only through the likelihood. In comparison, most frequentist inference procedures violate the likelihood principle, because inference will depend on the design of the trial or experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a likelihood function? It is closely related to the probability density (or mass) function. Taking a common example, consider some data that are binomially distributed (that is, they describe the outcomes of \\\\(n\\\\) binary events). Here is the binomial sampling distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(Y|\\theta) = {n \\choose y} \\theta^{y} (1-\\theta)^{n-y}$\n",

    "## Why be Bayesian?\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it is worth addressing the question of why one might consider an alternative statistical paradigm to the classical/frequentist statistical approach. After all, it is not always easy to specify a full probabilistic model, nor to obtain output from the model once it is specified. So, why bother?\n",
    "\n",
    "> ... the Bayesian approach is attractive because it is useful. Its usefulness derives in large measure from its simplicity. Its simplicity allows the investigation of far more complex models than can be handled by the tools in the classical toolbox.  \n",
    "*-- Link and Barker 2010*\n",
    "\n",
    "We already noted that there is just one estimator in Bayesian inference, which lends to its ***simplicity***. Moreover, Bayes affords a conceptually simple way of coping with multiple parameters; the use of probabilistic models allows very complex models to be assembled in a modular fashion, by factoring a large joint model into the product of several conditional probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian statistics is also attractive for its ***coherence***. All unknown quantities for a particular problem are treated as random variables, to be estimated in the same way. Existing knowledge is given precise mathematical expression, allowing it to be integrated with information from the study dataset, and there is formal mechanism for incorporating new information into an existing analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Bayesian statistics confers an advantage in the ***interpretability*** of analytic outputs. Because models are expressed probabilistically, results can be interpreted probabilistically. Probabilities are easy for users (particularly non-technical users) to understand and apply."

    "### Example: confidence vs. credible intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly-used measure of uncertainty for a statistical point estimate in classical statistics is the ***confidence interval***. Most scientists were introduced to the confidence interval during their introductory statistics course(s) in college. Yet, a large number of users mis-interpret the confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the mathematical definition of a 95% confidence interval for some unknown scalar quantity that we will here call \\\\(\\theta\\\\):\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"font-size:25px\">\n",
    "$Pr(a(Y) < \\theta < b(Y) | \\theta) = 0.95$\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "how the endpoints of this interval are calculated varies according to the sampling distribution of \\\\(Y\\\\), but for as an example, the confidence interval for the population mean when \\\\(Y\\\\) is normally distributed is calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Pr(\\bar{Y} - 1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}< \\theta < \\bar{Y} + 1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}) = 0.95$\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be tempting to use this definition to conclude that there is a 95% chance \\\\(\\theta\\\\) is between \\\\(a(Y)\\\\) and \\\\(b(Y)\\\\), but that would be a mistake. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that for frequentists, unknown parameters are **fixed**, which means there is no probability associated with them being any value except what they are fixed to. Here, the interval itself, and not \\\\(\\theta\\\\) is the random variable. The actual interval calculated from the data is just one possible realization of a random process, and it must be strictly interpreted only in relation to an infinite sequence of identical trials that might be (but never are) conducted in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "A valid interpretation of the above would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the experiment were repeated an infinite number of times, 95% of the calculated intervals would contain \\\\(\\theta\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the statistical notion of \"confidence\" entails, and this sets it apart from probability intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since they regard unknown parameters as random variables, Bayesians can and do use probability intervals to describe what is known about the value of an unknown quantity. These intervals are commonly known as ***credible intervals***.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of a 95% credible interval is:\n",

    "\n",
    "We are now ready (and willing!) to apply Bayesian methods to our problem. Gelman et al. (2013) describe the process of conducting Bayesian statistical analysis in 3 steps:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Specify a probability model\n",
    "\n",
    "As was noted above, Bayesian statistics involves using probability models to solve problems. So, the first task is to *completely specify* the model in terms of probability distributions. This includes everything: unknown parameters, data, covariates, missing data, predictions. All must be assigned some probability density.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step involves making choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- what is the form of the sampling distribution of the data?\n",
    "- what form best describes our uncertainty in the unknown parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Calculate a posterior distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The posterior distribution is formulated as a function of the probability model that was specified in Step 1. Usually, we can write it down but we cannot calculate it analytically. In fact, the difficulty inherent in calculating the posterior distribution for most models of interest is perhaps the major contributing factor for the lack of widespread adoption of Bayesian methods for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But**, once the posterior distribution is calculated, you get a lot for free:\n",
    "\n",
    "- point estimates\n",
    "- credible intervals\n",
    "- quantiles\n",
    "- predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Check your model\n",
    "\n",
    "Though frequently ignored in practice, it is critical that the model and its outputs be assessed before using the outputs for inference. Models are specified based on assumptions that are largely unverifiable, so the least we can do is examine the output in detail, relative to the specified model and the data that were used to fit the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we must ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "- does the model fit data?\n",
    "- are the conclusions reasonable?\n",
    "- are the outputs sensitive to changes in model structure?\n"
