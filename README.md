## Packages
- [Facebook nevergrad](https://facebookresearch.github.io/nevergrad/) A gradient-free optimization platform.
- [HumpDay](https://www.microprediction.com/blog/humpday) A Package to Help You Choose a Python Global Optimizer.
- [Scikit-Optimise](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/getting_started.html) Scikit-Optimize, or skopt, is a simple and efficient library to minimize (very) expensive and noisy black-box functions. It implements several methods for sequential model-based optimization. skopt aims to be accessible and easy to use in many contexts.The library is built on top of NumPy, SciPy and Scikit-Learn. We do not perform gradient-based optimization.
- [SciPy Optimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html) SciPy optimize provides functions for minimizing (or maximizing) objective functions, possibly subject to constraints. It includes solvers for nonlinear problems (with support for both local and global optimization algorithms), linear programing, constrained and nonlinear least-squares, root finding, and curve fitting.
- [CVXOPT](https://cvxopt.org/userguide/coneprog.html) CVXOPT is a free software package for convex optimization based on the Python programming language. It can be used with the interactive Python interpreter, on the command line by executing Python scripts, or integrated in other software via Python extension modules. Its main purpose is to make the development of software for convex optimization applications straightforward by building on Pythonâ€™s extensive standard library and on the strengths of Python as a high-level programming language
- [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/) CVXPY is an open source Python-embedded modeling language for convex optimization problems. It lets you express your problem in a natural way that follows the math, rather than in the restrictive standard form required by solvers.
