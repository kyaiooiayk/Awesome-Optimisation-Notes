# CVXPY
- CVXOPT is a free software package for convex optimization based on the Python programming language. 
- It can be used with the interactive Python interpreter, on the command line by executing Python scripts, or integrated in other software via Python extension modules. 
- Its main purpose is to make the development of software for convex optimization applications straightforward by building on Pythonâ€™s extensive standard library and on the strengths of Python as a high-level programming language
